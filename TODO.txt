I'm trying to get in the habit of planning out code more

Here's a rough level of steps I'm planning to do

1) Figure out how to get events
2) Figure up how to schedule reminders (just check events every hour is best atm)
        - Switching it to just a daily email i think
3) Figure out how to send emails
4) Tidy  up the code. Kinda messy and needs docstring stuff


without a doubt this will change, but overall it will hopefully stay the same
