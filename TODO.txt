I'm trying to get in the habit of planning out code more

Here's a rough level of steps I'm planning to do

1) Figure out how to get events
2) Figure up how to schedule reminders (just check events every hour is best atm)
3) Figure out how to send emails


without a doubt this will change, but overall it will hopefully stay the same
